                <p>Here at know your beer, we belive that no one should be buying unknown beer. Unknown beer is the worst, becuase, it's not known. It could be terrible, or it could be good. That's where we come in. We believe all beer lovers need to branch out and try new things, and Know Your Beer can help. Know Your Beer is a simple, easy to use search, where users can learn about the beer they are about to buy.</p><p>So, Know Your Beer. Branch Out. Live Life. Life's too short to drink bad beer.</p>
